const FAQS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What is TubeFetch?",
    a: "TubeFetch is a free, open REST API that lets developers search YouTube and retrieve direct download links for <code>MP4</code> (HD video) and <code>MP3</code> (audio). Pass any YouTube URL or a plain search query and get back structured JSON with metadata and media URLs — <strong>no API key required</strong>.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an API key or account?",
    a: "No. TubeFetch is completely free with <strong>zero authentication</strong> required. Simply call the endpoints from any HTTP client — a browser, curl, Postman, or your own app — and get results instantly.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between v1, v2, and v3?",
    a: "<strong>v1</strong> returns the richest response — full metadata (title, author, thumbnail, duration, views, likes, description, keywords, category, short_url) plus MP4 HD &amp; MP3 download links. <strong>v2</strong> is the fastest and lightest — returns just the video <code>title</code> and direct MP4 &amp; MP3 download links with minimal overhead; ideal for bots and scripts that only need the links. <strong>v3</strong> is search-only — pass a keyword or title and get a ranked list of up to 10 YouTube results (url, short_url, title, channel, duration, views, keywords, category); YouTube URLs are rejected by v3.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long are responses cached?",
    a: "All successful responses are cached <strong>in-memory for 5 minutes</strong> (fresh), then served stale for up to <strong>20 minutes</strong> while a background refresh runs (stale-while-revalidate). When a cached result is returned the response will include <code>\"cached\": true</code>. The <code>ApiCount</code> counter increments on every request regardless of cache status.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I search by title instead of a URL?",
    a: "Yes — v1 and v2 accept both a full YouTube URL (e.g. <code>https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ</code>) and a plain-text search query (e.g. <code>never gonna give you up</code>); the top result is used. v3 <strong>only accepts titles or keywords</strong> — passing a URL to v3 returns a 400 error. Use v1 or v2 for URL-based lookups.",
  },
  {
    q: "What formats are available?",
    a: "TubeFetch provides a direct <strong>MP4</strong> link (HD quality where available) and a direct <strong>MP3</strong> link (audio only). Links are sourced in real-time and may expire after a period of time, so they should be consumed promptly after fetching.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is ApiCount?",
    a: "<code>ApiCount</code> is a global request counter that increments by 1 on every download or search call to TubeFetch (<code>/api/v1/q</code>, <code>/api/v2/q</code>, <code>/api/v3/q</code>). Health checks (<code>/api/healthz</code>) and uptime pings (<code>/api/uptime</code>) do <strong>not</strong> increment it. View the live count at <code>/api/stats</code> or in the stats bar above.",
  },
  {
    q: "What categories does TubeFetch detect?",
    a: "TubeFetch automatically classifies content into: <strong>Music, Gaming, Education, News &amp; Politics, Comedy, Sports, Film &amp; Entertainment, Science &amp; Technology, Travel &amp; Vlogs, Food &amp; Cooking, Health &amp; Fitness, Beauty &amp; Fashion,</strong> and <strong>Entertainment</strong> (default). Classification is based on title, description, and keywords.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a rate limit?",
    a: "Yes. A <strong>global rate limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes</strong> applies across all endpoints. Download endpoints (<code>/api/v1/q</code>, <code>/api/v2/q</code>, <code>/api/v3/q</code>) have an additional stricter limit of <strong>60 requests per minute</strong> to protect upstream services. Exceeding either limit returns a <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> response.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is TubeFetch free for commercial use?",
    a: "TubeFetch is free for personal and educational use. Commercial use is at your own discretion — please ensure compliance with <strong>YouTube's Terms of Service</strong> and applicable copyright laws. The developer (MJL) accepts no liability for any misuse. All content belongs to its respective owners.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does `cached: true` mean in the response?",
    a: "When <code>\"cached\": true</code> appears in a response, it means the result was served directly from TubeFetch's in-memory cache — no upstream network call was made. Cached responses are near-instant. The cache stays fresh for <strong>5 minutes</strong>; after that, a stale copy is returned immediately while a background refresh updates the cache (stale-while-revalidate). <code>ApiCount</code> still increments on every request, cached or not.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do download links expire?",
    a: "The MP4 and MP3 URLs returned by TubeFetch are direct CDN links generated by YouTube's own servers. These links are <strong>time-limited</strong> (typically expiring within a few hours to a day). TubeFetch does not control link expiry — it fetches the link fresh when you make a request. To avoid stale links, consume the URL promptly after receiving it and avoid caching it on your end for more than an hour.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if both download sources fail?",
    a: "TubeFetch uses a two-source fallback chain. <strong>Source 1</strong> is <code>@distube/ytdl-core</code> (direct YouTube CDN, no third-party relay). <strong>Source 2</strong> is <code>nayan-media-downloaders</code> (routes through ymcdn.org). If Source 1 fails (e.g. YouTube bot detection on server IPs), Source 2 is tried automatically. If both fail, the API returns <code>\"mp4\": null, \"mp3\": null</code> rather than a 500 error — so your app never crashes, it simply handles null links.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I download age-restricted or private videos?",
    a: "No. TubeFetch cannot access <strong>age-restricted</strong>, <strong>private</strong>, or <strong>members-only</strong> videos. These require authenticated sessions that TubeFetch does not support. Attempting to fetch such videos will result in an error or null media links.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the `ms` field in the response?",
    a: "The <code>ms</code> field is the <strong>server-side response time in milliseconds</strong> — measured from when TubeFetch received your request to when the response was sent. It reflects actual processing time including any upstream fetches. Cached responses show a very low <code>ms</code> value (typically under 5 ms). Use it to benchmark latency.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is `short_url` in the response?",
    a: "<code>short_url</code> is the compact YouTube share link format: <code>https://youtu.be/&lt;videoId&gt;</code>. It is functionally identical to the full <code>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&lt;videoId&gt;</code> URL. It is included in v1 responses (top-level) and in each v3 search result item for convenience.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I handle 429 Too Many Requests errors?",
    a: "A <code>429</code> response means you have exceeded a rate limit. Implement <strong>exponential backoff</strong> — wait before retrying, doubling the delay on each subsequent failure (e.g. 1 s → 2 s → 4 s → 8 s). The global limit resets every 15 minutes; the download limit resets every minute. If you need higher throughput for a legitimate use case, consider self-hosting a private instance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does TubeFetch support playlists?",
    a: "No. TubeFetch works on <strong>individual videos</strong> only. Playlist URLs are not supported — passing a playlist URL will either fail or return results for the first video in the playlist depending on how the URL is parsed. Use v3 with a search keyword to discover multiple videos.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use TubeFetch from a mobile app or browser extension?",
    a: "Yes. TubeFetch is a standard REST API accessible from any HTTP client. You can call it from <strong>Android</strong> (Retrofit, OkHttp), <strong>iOS</strong> (URLSession, Alamofire), <strong>React Native</strong>, <strong>Flutter</strong>, browser extensions, or any server-side backend. Note: calling TubeFetch directly from a browser page may trigger CORS restrictions — consider proxying through your own backend.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who built TubeFetch and is it open source?",
    a: "TubeFetch was built by <strong>MJL</strong>. The source code is available on the project repository for educational and personal use. See the <strong>Copyright Disclaimer</strong> section for full legal terms. Commercial use, redistribution, or removal of attribution is prohibited without written permission.
